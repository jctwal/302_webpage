          <p> This is my introductory webpage for ICT 302. I am interested in taking this
          course because I like to&nbsp;<br> learn how certain technologies work from the inside out.
          I don't know much about content <br> management or HTML, so I'm looking forward to
          this semester and learning about these <br> systems, as well as gaining new skills.</p>
